    <string name="malhiya_intro">My name is Malhiya Arnib. I love coding and learning new skills! Some of my hobbies include
painting and trying a different activity every few months (currently it’s trying to solve a Rubik’s
cube faster). I also enjoy teaching concepts in computer science and other STEM subjects. The new insights and perspectives I learn from the
different activities in my life allow me to grow personally and academically. I am eager to learn more about Android development and believe
CodePath will provide me the skills, guidance, and support to pursue a successful career in this field!</string>
